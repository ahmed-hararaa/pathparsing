# pathparsing

This library is a Go port of the Dart path_parsing library. Original Dart source: https://github.com/flutter/packages/tree/main/third_party/packages/path_parsing

The original library is part of Flutter's package ecosystem and provides utilities for parsing SVG path data. This Go implementation aims to replicate the functionality as closely as possible.
